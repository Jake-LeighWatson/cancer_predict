The folder contains 5 documents - 2 scripts and 3 input csv's.

1) Script to model COAD survival based on isoform switch genes, comparing the performance metrics to a random set of genes - COAD_LogReg_Isoform_survival.
- Input the isoform_switch file and all_genes_file csv's to run script. 
- Script then performs grid search for best logistic regression parameters
- Then cross validation 
- Runs model on unseen test set of data
- Plots PCA explained variance plots
- Also has a function to extract the SelectFromModel selected features as a list.

2) Script to model COAD survival based on cis_eQTL genes, comparing the performance metrics to a random set of genes - COAD_LogReg_ciseQTL_survival.
- Input the cis_eQTL_95_file and all_genes_file csv's to run script. 
- Script then performs grid search for best logistic regression parameters
- Then cross validation 
- Runs model on unseen test set of data
- Plots PCA explained variance plots
- Also has a function to extract the SelectFromModel selected features as a list.
