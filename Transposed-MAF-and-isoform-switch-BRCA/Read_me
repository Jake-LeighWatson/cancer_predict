Contains 4 scripts demonstrating the parsing of the MAF, FPKM files and isoform files for BRCA
with two additional scripts showing the retrival of Ensembl IDs for the isoform switches (R script) and one displaying the filtering of FPKM in relation to the isoform switches

Pipeline applied in following order:

1) BRCA_GE_MAF file first
- This file filters the MAF for protein coding variants and saves as dataframe. 
- Imports the tumour and normal samples FPKM files
- Filters for protein coding genes (using previously provided R script)
- Searches for duplicated genes and changes the name of one, whilst dropping the other three duplicates.
- Transposes and concatenates the tumour and normal samples into one dataframe, with additonal 'Cancer' column where a value of 1 = tumour, 0 = normal.

2) BRCA_isoform_parse
- Takes isoform txt file and splits columns to have seperate gene symbol and Entrez ID columns, before saving as new csv.

3) BRCA_isoform_gene_to_ensembl (R script)
- Isoforms were detected using hg19 => run the R script on the isoform Entrez IDs to return hg38 gene symbol, Ensembl IDs and Entrez IDs.
- Some genes duplicated with alternative chromosomal locations => these duplicates deleted.
- Note that some isoform switch genes lost during conversion (two in the case of BRCA).
- Export isoform switch file with Ensembl IDs

4) BRCA_isoform_switch_filter
- Checks for isoform switch genes not found in FPKM table
- Change gene name in isoform switch table for mismatches (two incase of BRCA) -  didn't change name in FPKM as I guess we want these symbols to stay consistant.
- FPKM file then filtered for isoform switches (with the added 'Cancer' column) - hopefully providing a table ready for modelling. 
- Note that in other cancer types some genes (one max) were missing in the FPKM file so these genes we're removed from isoform switch table
