This folder contains three documents as decribed below:

1) A PDF (Project / ML plan.pdf) displaying a report plan for the introduction and methods.
  Within the Methods section there is a section titled 'Machine Learning' which discusses my plan for the ML part of the project including:
  - potential ML classifiers to use
  - potential perfomance metrics
  - How to handle imbalanced data (not sure if theres a preferred method?)
  - Cross validation to handle the small sample size 
  - Feature engineering and selection

2) A jupyter notebook script (COAD_random_forest_cis_95) detailing a pratice attempt at applying a random forest (RF) model to COAD data filtered for cis eQTLs
  - Starts with a simple RF applied to cis data
  - Then looks at working with the imbalanced data through applying a class_weight and also resampling.
  - Quick look at cross validation
  - Looks at an array of different feature selection techniques.

3) COAD_FPKM_cis_eQTL_95.csv which can be plugged into the above script.
