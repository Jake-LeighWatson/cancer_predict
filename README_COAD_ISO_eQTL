Attached are two scripts relating to the extraction of isoform switches and eQTLs for COAD.
I've uploaded the scripts more to just generally show what the isoform switch and eQTL data looks like,
as the scripts, alongisde the MAF and FPKM files, may need changing to account for the lack of normal MAFs.
I have downloaded and applied the attached isoform switch and eQTL scripts to 8 cancer types from the TCGA (in case we do end up discrimintating between cancer types)
with these 8 cancer types selected on the basis of seeming to have a sufficient amount of samples for modelling, whilst having isoform switch data availble.
