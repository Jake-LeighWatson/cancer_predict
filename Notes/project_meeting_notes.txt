# -- Discuss overall project & data sources

* Locate and extract gene expression (FPKM) datasets for COAD from TCGA.
* Extract VCF/MAF files for COAD from TCGA.
* Identify patient ID in these samples & match gene expression with 
  MAF files per patient.
* How many samples do we have for which both data types are available?
  (i.e. gene expression data & genomimc variants)

* Extract isoform switches from iso-ktsp resource. 
 => Extract genes that have known isoform switches in colon carcinoma. 
 ! Not enough samples to get many matches across multiple data types.
 Here, this resource will be used to reduce the dimensionality of 
 the input feature space (genes), with those genes known to have
 isoform switches associated with colon carcinoma.
 
* Extract regulatory variants (cis-eQTL & trans-eQTL) from PancanQTL resource.
  => Extract the associated genes that are known to be dysregulated by each cis-eQTL.
  => Extract the associated genes that are known to be dysregulated by each trans-eQTL.
  Use these lists of genes to refine the feature space: 
  + Consider only those genes with cis-eQTL regulatory variants.
  + Consider only those genes with trans-eQTL regulatory variants.
  + Consider only those genes with both types (cis/trans eQTL) of regulatory variants.

 ! No information on cis/trans-eQTL from Normal samples. 
 So no comparison between tumour and normal samples.
 Here, the PancanQTL resource will be used to reduce the dimensionality of 
 the input feature space (genes), by pre-selecting those genes known to be 
 affected/dysregulated by regulatory variants in tumour samples.

# -- Meeting re. extracting datasets from TCGA online resource.

# -- Cancer types
* Extend search to select cancer types based on availability of cases 
  & CMRE interest.
* See number of sample cases per cancer type in TCGA on GDCA portal:
  https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/ 

  Selection:
	* Colon adenocarninoma (COAD; 460)
	* Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD; 499), 
	* Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA; 1098) 
	* Glioma (GBMLGG; 1129 cases).

  Rationale: 
	COAD & PRAD: two cancer types of interest to CMRE. 
	BRCA & GBMLGG: largest number of cases across all 33 cancer types in TCGA. 

# -- Extract gene expression (normalised as FPKM) 
TCGAbiolinks: An R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis with GDC data

# -- Extract MAF files: check Tumour_Sample_Barcode as it contains patient ID.
Use this field to relate patient ID between data types.

# -- Overall feature filtering/pre-selection prior to feature selection within CV
Filter gene expression based on:
	* A minimum amount of expression (FPKM >1) across at least 10% of samples per gene.
	* Genes associated with isoform switches in specific cancer types.
	* Genes dysregulated with known cis-/trans-eQTL in specific cancer types.
Filter genomic variants:
	* Select Protein-coding variants only
	* Protein-coding variants affecting genes known to be associated with:
		* Isoform switches in specific cancer types
		* Dysregulation due to cis/trans eQTL in specific cancer types.

# -- Recap extraction of data

# -- Plan re. prediction of cancer-specific cases vs. normal samples
# -- Objectives

1/ Divide samples into train/val sets.

2/ Train ML models based on gene expression data 
   # Mutiple input features based on the various filtering as discussed above.
3/ Perform feature selection from transcriptomics through CV.

4/ Train ML models based on genomic variants.
   # Mutiple input features based on the various filtering as discussed above.
5/ Perform feature selection from genomics through CV.

6/ Build ML model based on key features identified in steps 3 & 5.
7/ Compare model performances when built based on the various gene/variant sets.
