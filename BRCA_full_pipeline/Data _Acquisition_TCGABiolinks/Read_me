This folder contains:

1) 'TCGABiolinks_BRCA' R script
- Shows the script used to download RNA-sequencing data (in FPKM) from the TCGA for both 'Primary Tumor' and 'Solid Tissue Normal' BRCA samples using TCGABiolinks.
- Two seperate csv's (tumour or normal data) containing FPKM gene expression values (FPKM), alongisde gene HUGO symbol, Ensembl ID and TCGA Sample ID, for BRCA are subsequnetly exported. 
- The csv's created ('FPKM_BRCA_tumour.csv' and 'FPKM_BRCA_normal.csv') are too big to upload but can be automatically produced by running the R scipt - as long as you have the required R libraries installed.


4) 'Protein_Coding_Genes' R script
- Script utilisng biomaRt to download table of human protein coding genes aligned to hg38. 
- The tsv created is shown in 'ensembl_GRCH38_protein_coding_genes.tsv'
