This folder and the folders it contains present an example of a full computational pipeline used within the MSc Precision Medicine project.
BRCA is used as an example cancer type as it was used for all levels of data analysis (e.g. tumour or normal, cancer type and survival classification). 
The same process was repeated / used for all cancer types studied. 
Each folder contains Python or R-based scripts, the required input and output files (where possible) and an additional read_me file detailing the folders contents.
Jupyter notebook was used to produce the Python scripts which can be viewed within git - allowing the dataframes, results and plots to be viewed (within reason) without the requirement of external software.

The pipeline runs in the following order (folders named accordingly):

1) Data Acquisition (TCGABiolinks)
2) Data Parsing 1 (Tumour or Normal)
3) Data Parsing 2 (Cancer Type)
4) Data Parsing 3 (Isoform Switches)
5) Data Parsing 4 (eQTLs)
6) Data Parsing 5 (Survival)
7) ML 1 (Model Selection)
8) ML 2 (LR Tumour or Normal)




Please refer to the read_me files within each folder throughout.
Note that some input and output csv files were too big to upload to git.
If running the scripts externally/seperately the input file paths / names will need to changed to accomodate your file paths / names. 
Additionally, if running the scripts externally with new data (downloaded by yourself) or even using the data provided, your results may vary from the results stated due to stochastic nature of the models.

Please refer to section 2.1 in the report and use the links in Table A.1 to access the isoform, eQTL and clinical data - downloading this data is not covered in this pipepline.
