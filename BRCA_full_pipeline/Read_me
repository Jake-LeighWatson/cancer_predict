This folder and the folders it contains present an example full computational pipeline used within the MSc Precision Medicine project.
BRCA is used as an example cancer type as it was used for all levels of data analysis (e.g. tumour or normal, cancer type and survival classification). 
The same process was used for all cancer types studied. 
Each folder contains Python or R-based scripts, the required input and output files (where possible) and an additional read_me file detailing the folders contents.
Jupyter notebook was used to produce the Python scripts which can be viewed within git - allowing the dataframes, results and plots to be viewed (within reason) without the requirement of external software.

The pipeline runs in the following order (folders named accordingly):

1) Data Acquisition (TCGABiolinks)
2) 


Please refer to the read_me files within each folder throughout.

Please refer to section 2.1 in the report and use the links in Table A.1 to access the isoform and eQTL data - downloading this data is not covered in this pipepline.
