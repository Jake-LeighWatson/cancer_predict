This folder contains three scripts displaying the LR models applied for tumour or normal classification with either isoform switch, cis-eQTL or trans-eQTL filtering.

1) Will detail the isoform switch-based 'BRCA_LR_iso_TN' script - simliar process followed for cis- and trans-eQTL

- Load both:
  - isoform switch filtered, matched BRCA csv (provided in folder as 'BRCA_FPKM_protein_isoform_filtered_matched.csv') 
  - alongside the matched csv containing all protein coding genes (for taking random subsets - provided in folder as 'BRCA_FPKM_protein_all_matched.csv').
- Check for missing data
- Check tumour to normal sample ratio 
- Do initial train_test_split to extract the 30% of test data (no training performed on this data) and 70% development/training data - use stratify to keep tumour to normal ratio during split 
- Repeat the process for three random sets of genes by using .sample function on the dataframe containing all protein coding genes.

- Grid search function then created which:
  - Applies default LR classifier utilising the previously detailed Pipeline and repeat stratified 3 fold CV.
  - Searches across a parameter grid that encompasses LR penalty, C value and solver. 
  - Returns a dictionary containing the best parameters.
  - This function is run on the isoform switch subset training data and the three random gene subsets (individually) training data.

- Cross validation fuction then created to evaluate model performance using the best parameters determined using the grid search.
  - Again this function uses a Pipeline and repeat stratified 3 fold CV.
  - However, rather than default LR classifier, the grid search determined paramters are set for the LR classifier
  - Function then returns AUROC score and other metrics (F1, precision, recall, accuracy)
  - This function is again run on the isoform switch subset training data and the three random gene subsets (individually) training data.

- Model test function is then created to evaluate the models performance on the unused test data. 
  - Function uses the Pipeline with grid search determined parameters used by the LR classifier - but no CV or stratified K fold performed. 
  - The Pipeline is fit to the training / development data and then predictions are made on the test data. 
  - AUROC score and a classification report is returned. 
  - This function is run on the isoform switch subset test data with the AUROC score returned taken as the model performance provided in the report.
  - This function is also run on the three random gene subsets (individually) test data - with the mean AUROC score and the standard deviation between the three provided in the report.
 

##### Additional function at the end to return the model feature / gene importance #####
