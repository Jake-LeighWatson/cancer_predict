This folde contains the Python script used for model selection.

1) 'BRCA_multiple_models_test'

- Loads the BRCA isoform switch and eQTL filtered files for both tumour or normal and survival classification.
- Checks for missing data
- Splits the data into X (features / genes) and y (target column - either 'Cancer' (T or N) or 'Three_year_status' (survival))
- Function created to compare models across the different data subsets
  - Creates lists of classifiers (LR,RF,SVC) and corresponsing classifiers to be used in feature selection
  - Pipeline incorporating StandardScaler, PCA, SelectFromModel feature selection and a classifier
  - For loop that irerates over the classifiers, incorporating the pipeline and repeat stratified 3 fold CV - returning the mean AUROC score (alongisde other metrics)
- This function is then applied to all subsets of data.
