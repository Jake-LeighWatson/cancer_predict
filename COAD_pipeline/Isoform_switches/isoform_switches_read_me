This section details the pipeline for isoform switches.

1) Isoform switch parsing utilising the COAD_isoform_parse script

- Loads the COAD isoform switch data downloaded from the iso-ktsp database / paper
- Creates new columns containing the gene symbol, Entrez ID and transcript IDs for each isoform switch
- Shows the number of isoform swithces
- Exports new dataframe as csv ('COAD_isoform_switches.csv')

2) The 'COAD_isoform_switches.csv' (from 1) is then passed through the 'COAD_Isoform_gene_to_ensembl' R script.

- Loads COAD_isoform_switches.csv
- Converts the Entrez ID (since hg19) to Ensembl ID (hg38) via biomaRt 
- Exports new dataframe containing Ensembl IDs as 'COAD_isoform_switches_ensembl.csv'

3) The 'COAD_isoform_switches_ensembl.csv' (from 2) is then passed through the 'COAD_isoform_switch_filter' script.

- Loads the COAD_isoform_switches_ensembl.csv and the transposed FPKM dataframe for COAD
- Checks for genes not present in FPKM table that are in the isoform switch table
- if neccessary, drop mismatching genes (not generally required, need to drop a few for a few cancer types)
- Filter the FPKM table in relation to the isoform switch Ensembl IDs, whilst keeping the 'Cancer' target column too
- Export the isoform switch filtered table as 'COAD_FPKM_protein_isoform_filtered.csv'
