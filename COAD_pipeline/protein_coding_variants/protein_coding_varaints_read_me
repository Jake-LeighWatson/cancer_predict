This section details the 'potential' pipeline for the protein coding variants.

Only uses one script. Not sure if what I'm doing is what is required though

1)

- Load the FPKM and MAF_protein (VEP = HIGH or MODERATE) dataframes
- Creates a new MAF_PCV (protein coding variants) table by:
  - groupby ('Hugo_Symbol','Ensembl_ID','Tumor_Sample_Barcode').size() => count number of instances gene appears per sample
  - Table also unstacked with NA values filled with 0, and the table is transposed => Sample ID become rows and Genes are columns
  - I did a few checks (included in script) to see if this provided the number of mutations per gene per sample and it seems to do this
- Then create a rough plot ('COAD Number of Protein Coding Varaints per Gene - Total Across All Samples') 
  showing total number of times gene appears across all tumour samples
- Then create a cleaner plot ('COAD Mean Number of Protein Coding Varaints per Gene per Sample 99 percentile (Normalised)') 
  showing the mean number of times gene appears per sample  
  ... is this showing the average number of protein coding variants per gene as required?? 
      or would I have to look at transcript IDs instead for protein coding variants??

Goes on to filter in relation to 99 percentile genes.
