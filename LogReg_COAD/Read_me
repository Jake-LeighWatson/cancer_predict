The folder contains:

1) Two csv files 'isoform_switch_file' and 'all_genes_file'.
- The isoform file contains the FPKM (gene expression) data for the isoform switch associated genes for COAD (13 genes / features in total)
- The all genes file contains the FPKM data for all the genes associated with COAD

2) A script (COAD_LogReg_Isoform_model) that applies a logistic regression model to the data
- First it loads the above csvs (you should just be able to change the file / filepath in the script and then simply press run) 
- Does train test splits on the isoform data and a random set of genes from the all genes data. 
  - This is done to keep out 30% of 'unseen' test data to test the final model
- Grid searches are then performed
- Followed by some cross validation 
- Before final modelling is performed on the unseen test data.
